    "This notebook introduces developers and data scientists to web development using Flask.\n",

    "`Flask` is one of many available `web server gateway interface (WSGI)` tools that enable you to create rapid and scalable websites and apps. It also has a relatively accessible learning curve. The barebones capacity of Flask is particularly valuable when prototyping and iterating upon products, services, and machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) is a microframework that is barebones by design. Flask has no [**data abstraction layer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer), does not perform [**form validation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#What_is_form_validation), nor does it include custom packages if they already exist as a package/library, elsewhere. This makes Flask particularly easy to customize, and leads to less bloated systems.\n",
