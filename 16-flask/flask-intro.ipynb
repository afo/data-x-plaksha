    "This notebook introduces developers and data scientists to web development using Flask. Flask is one of many available web server gateway interface (WSGI) tools that enable rapid and scalable websites and apps with a relatively accessible learning curve. The barebones capacity of Flask is particularly valuable when prototyping and iterating upon products, services, and machine learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Flask**](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) is a microframework that is barebones by design. Flask has no [**data abstraction layer**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_abstraction_layer), does not perform [**form validation**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation#What_is_form_validation), nor does it include custom packages if they already exist as a package/library, elsewhere. This makes Flask particularly easy to customize, and leads to less bloated systems.\n",
