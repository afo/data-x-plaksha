    "This notebook mainly goes over how to get data with the Python packages `requests` and  `BeautifulSoup`. However, there are many other Python packages that can be used for scraping.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two very popular and widely used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **[Selenium:](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)** Pyton scraper that can act as a human when visiting websites, almost like a macro. Makes sense of modern Javascript based websites built with React, Angular etc.\n",
    "* **[Scrapy:](https://scrapy.org/)** For automated scripting and has a lot of built in tools for web crawling and scraping that can facilitate the process (e.g. time based, IP rotation etc). Mainly script based scraping for larger projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### API: Application Programming Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Many services offer API's to grab data (Twitter, Wikipedia, Reddit etc.) We have already used an API in the Pandas notebook when we grabbed stock data in CSV format to do analysis. If a good API exists, it is usually the preferred method of obtaining data."
