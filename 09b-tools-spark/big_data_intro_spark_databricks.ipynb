    "Databricks is a platform for running Spark without complex cluster management or tedious maintenance tasks. Spark is a distributed computation framework for executing code in parallel across many different machines. Databricks is the Spark team's enterprise solution makes big data simple by providing Spark as a hosted solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Databricks Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "-   ****Workspaces**** : Where you store the ****notebooks**** and ****libraries****.\n",
    "-   ****Notebooks**** : Like Jupyter Notebooks that can run `Scala`, `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, or `Markdown`. Define language by `%[language name]` at the top of the cell. Connect to a cluster to run.\n",
    "-   ****Dashboards**** can be created from ****notebooks**** as a way of displaying the output of cells without the code.\n",
    "-   ****Libraries**** : Packages / Modules. You can install them via pypi.\n",
    "-   ****Tables**** : Structured data, that can be stored in data lake / cloud storage. Stored on Cluster or cached in memory.\n",
    "-   ****Clusters**** : Groups of computers that you treat as a single computer to perform operations on big sets of data.\n",
    "-   ****Jobs**** : Schedule execution on ****notebooks**** or Python scripts. They can be created either manually or via the REST API.\n",
    "-   ****Apps**** : 3rd party integrations with the Databricks platform like Tableau."

    "### Spark's history\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark was developed by founders of Databricks in AMPLab at UC Berkeley. Started 2009, donated to Apache open source in 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Contexts/Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Spark 2.X many used the `sparkContext` made available as `sc` and the `SQLContext` made available as `sqlContext`. The `sqlContext` makes a lot of DataFrame functionality available while the `sparkContext` focuses more on the Apache Spark engine itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spark 2.X, there is just one context - the `SparkSession`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Key interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   ****The DataFrame**** : Collection of distributed `Row` types (note no indicies for look up). Similar to pandas or R dataframe.\n",
    "-   ****The RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)**** : Interface to a sequence of data objects that consist of one or more types that are located across a variety of machines in a cluster. Focus on DataFrames as those will be supersets of the current RDD functionality.\n",
