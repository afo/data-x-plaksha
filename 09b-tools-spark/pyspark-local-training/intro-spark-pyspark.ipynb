    "Spark is a platform for big data and cluster computing. Spark lets distribute computations over clusters with multiple nodes (computing instances). Each node works different subsets of the data and carries out a part of the total calculations required, so that both data processing and computation are performed in parallel over the nodes in the cluster. \n",
    "\n",
    "Big data, parallelization also introduces greater complexity. In order to decide if `pyspark` is for you, you can answer the following questions:\n",

    "## Step 1: Connect to a Cluster\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in using Spark is connecting to a cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the cluster will be hosted on a remote machine that's connected to all other nodes. There will be one computer, called **the master** that manages splitting up the data and the computations. The master is connected to the rest of the computers in the cluster, which are called **slaves**. The master sends the slaves data and calculations to run, and they send their results back to the master.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to run our cluster locally, therefore we will not connect to another computer, instead we will run them locally on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SparkContext sc\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating the connection is as simple as creating an instance of the SparkContext class. The class constructor takes a few optional arguments that allow you to specify the attributes of the cluster you're connecting to.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object holding all these attributes can be created with the SparkConf() constructor. Take a look at the documentation for all the details!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you start pyspark you will have a SparkContext called sc already available in your workspace."

    "Spark's core data structure is the Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD). This is a low level object that lets Spark work its magic by splitting data across multiple nodes in the cluster. However, RDDs are hard to work with directly, so in this course you'll be using the Spark DataFrame abstraction built on top of RDDs.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When you start modifying and combining columns and rows of data, there are many ways to arrive at the same result, but some often take much longer than others. When using RDDs, it's up to the data scientist to figure out the right way to optimize the query, but the DataFrame implementation has much of this optimization built in!\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with Spark DataFrames, you first have to create a SparkSession object from your SparkContext. You can think of the **SparkContext as your connection to the cluster** and the **SparkSession as your interface with that connection**.\n",
